In 2016, an initial blog post titled 'Hello World' seems too easy.  The new getting started example has to be a Todo List.

* [x] Get the blog setup and deployed (self-fulfilling prophecy)
* [ ] Add the flair (37 pieces optional)
* [ ] Transfer over old blog content (circa 2008)
* [ ] Come up with some ideas to blog about (probably web things)
